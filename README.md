# DA-NVMR-dataset

Two kinds of datasets are included, which are “Simulated night-time vehicle image dataset (S-NVID)” and “Real night-time vehicle image dataset (R-NVID)”.

S-NVID dataset Description:

Simulated night-time images are sampled from CompCars[1] dataset, then corrected by gamma function for considerable simulation. We empirically set gamma equals 10. Gaussian noise(σ=0.1), Poisson noise(lam=0.03), and Pepper noise (SNR=0.95) are used to fully simulate night-time condition

R-NVID Dataset Description:

Images of two domains (night-time and daytime), which came from on-road real time surveillance systems. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because the images came from on-road real time surveillance systems are private, we only provide 200 sample images for public. If you need more data, you must contact 252781411@qq.com and promise that you will only use the data for research, not for commercial or other purposes, and promise not to disseminate the dataset privately.
